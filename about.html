          <h3>A little about me.</h3>
          <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Hi! Jamie here. I am an aspiring full stack developer currently attending a bootcamp. My background spans small businesses and large corporations. I started a multimedia company when I was younger and offered customizing website templates, social media campaigns, and photography. I also was a project manager and archaeology instructor working closely with teams. From there I settled into Oil and Gas working in the Enterprise Oracle inventory system.
