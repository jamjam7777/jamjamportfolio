          Hi! Jamie here. I am an aspiring full stack developer currently
          attending a bootcamp. My background spans small businesses and large
          corporations. I started a multimedia company when I was younger and
          offered customizing website templates, social media campaigns, and
          photography. I also was a project manager and archaeology instructor
          working closely with teams. From there I settled into Oil and Gas
          working in the Enterprise Oracle inventory system. Check out my
          portfolio and if you like what you see, contact me!
